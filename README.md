This repository contains code and other supplementary data to accompany the preprint *The pinning ideal of a multiloop* by Christopher-Lloyd Simon and Ben Stucky, which is available on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16216). The file ```planeloop.py``` contains the implementations of the algorithms described there.

The most accessible information here is on a digital catalog called the LooPindex which is served from the docs folder and available at [https://christopherlloyd.github.io/LooPindex/](https://christopherlloyd.github.io/LooPindex/).

There are also some other figures and data available on pdfs in the folders [catalogs/](https://github.com/ChristopherLloyd/LooPin/tree/main/catalogs) and [counterexamples/](https://github.com/ChristopherLloyd/LooPin/tree/main/counterexamples).
